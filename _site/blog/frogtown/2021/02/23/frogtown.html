<p><a href="https://beta.frogtown.me/">Frogtown</a> is the name of my Magic: The Gathering deck building site, that allows you to export decks for play on Tabletop Simulator.</p>

<p>Frogtown has been my flagship project since 2015, although I don’t play MTG anymore myself. The older version is at <a href="https://www.frogtown.me/">https://www.frogtown.me/</a>, and the newer at <a href="https://beta.frogtown.me/">https://beta.frogtown.me/</a>. Frogtown has been my playground for learning various web development technologies, most recently (meaning several years ago) that’s React and Typescript. I tend to only work on it when people bring major issues to me, or there’s something new that I want to test out. Currently there aren’t many competing services in the community, so it’s open source and I’m actively encouraging others to get into the space.</p>

#Projects


##Frogtown
A Magic: The Gathering deck building site, that allows you to export decks for play on Tabletop Simulator.

Frogtown has been my flagship project since 2015, although I don't play MTG anymore myself. The older version is at https://www.frogtown.me/, and the newer at https://beta.frogtown.me/. Frogtown has been my playground for learning various web development technologies, most recently that's React and Typescript. I tend to only work on it when people bring major issues to me, or there's something new that I want to test out. Currently there aren't many competing services in the community, so it's open source and I'm actively encouraging others to get into the space.

##[Zoomie Cars](https://github.com/ToyDragon/ZoomieCars)
Zoomie Cars is a small racing game meant for TTY graphics, using VT escape sequences for rendering. I absolutely love this project, it was a lot of fun to learn about the limitations, and ways to abuse, the VT specs.

##[Coin Clicker](https://github.com/ToyDragon/CoinClicker)
Coin Clicker is my attempt at an idle/clicker game. It's reasonably far along, but I stopped progressing it because I couldn't make it fun. I think about it often, and may pick it back up later.

##[Spotsylvania]()
My current project, that I will describe when it is further along :)

##Algorithmic Trading
A project I'm thinking of exploring more, about algorithmic trading of crypto currencies. I'm interested, but not sure how much opportunity is available.

#Retired Projects
These projects maybe went somewhere, but they are dead.

##Risk of Rain 2 Modding
I was really excited for Risk of Rain 2 when it came out, and played a ton of it. I got into the modding community early, and shipped several small mods:
1. [Healing Helper](https://github.com/ToyDragon/ROR2ModHealingHelper)- Turn into a healing drone when you die in multiplayer, instead of spectating. I truly think this should have been in the base game, it is soooooo much more fun than the normal death mechanics.
2. [Fix for engineer turrets](https://github.com/ToyDragon/ROR2ModEngineerLunarCoinFix)- The base game had a bug where your engineer character didn't get credit for killing things with his turrets. This fixed that. The first major update to the game included this fix :)
3. [Cheating with chat commands](https://github.com/ToyDragon/ROR2ModChatCommandCheats)- There were several cheat mods, this one was special in that it was operated through chat commands, and therefore only the host had to have it installed. Other players could type out their cheats, and have them applied by the host. This is also what promted me to make my own mod manager, so that I could add a UI for the cheats if you had the mod installed yourself.
4. [Mod manager](https://github.com/ToyDragon/ROR2ModShared)- The mod manager that I built to manage my own installed mods, and to provide shared utility code for my mods.

The mod manager ended up being the most popular mod of mine by far, it was largely a clone of Unity-Mod-Manager, I put very little effort into it. Unfortunately, there was a lot of internal conflict in the mod ommunity which really turned me off, and as the mod manager fell out of date people got sour with me in particular. Now the project is long dead, but at it's peak this was probably my most popular project, with something like 30k unique users. It's unfortunate things went the way they did here, but ultimately I'm happy to have left. Mods largely have gotten worse since those first couple months, which is honestly probably because the vanilla game is so great already, players don't want game changing mods.

##[MTG Scraper](https://github.com/ToyDragon/GathererScraper)
MTG is a huge community with a lot of card databases. This was my attempt at contributing to that. I started this because of an API break from Scryfall caused me to have an outage, but ended up just sticking with Scryfall. I only work on Frogtown every like 6 months or so, so having long-term stability is a must. Scryfall has made breaking API changes in the past, but I don't think they'll change the current APIs for at least a very long time.

##FrogWow
This was a fork of Frogtown, with the card database swapped out for WoW cards. It had the premade decks listed and available for download, which I think was a great improvement over Frogtown. Unfortunately, I never played WoWTCG, and not many others did, so it's dead now.


#Garbage Projects
These projects never went and never will go anywhere.

##[MTG Premade Decks](https://github.com/ToyDragon/MTGPremadeDecks)
Last I checked there isn't a great resource of computer-processable retail MTG decks. Easy downloading of these decks is

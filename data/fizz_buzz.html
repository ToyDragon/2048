  <h3>Scenario: Fizz Buzz Bugs</h3>
  <p>FizzBuzz is a common intro program that loops over a bunch of numbers, and prints Fizz if they're a multiple of 3, Buzz if they're a multiple of 5, and FizzBuzz if it's a multiple of both.</p>

    This is the gridworld version. We have a red bug that walks, and plants a flower every 3rd tile. We have a blue bug that walks, and plants a flower every 5th tile.

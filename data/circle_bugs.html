  <h3>Scenario: Circle Bugs</h3>
  <p>This scenario demonstrates two bugs with identical behavior, but very different implementations.</p>
  <p>
    The first bug, the red one called "bug A", was implemented by a dumbass.
    It's hardcoded to do the same exact 24 movements, repeatedly, until it dies a slow and cold bug death.
    Imagine if you wanted to extend the radius of it's circle path by 1, you'd have to change all the indices, you'd have to add or remove a bunch of moveForward commands.
    It'd be crazy.

  <p>
    The other bug, the blue one called "bug B", is god-tier.
    It's implemented to be flexible. Altering the circle path is easy. You could even change it to go in a square pattern pretty easily.
